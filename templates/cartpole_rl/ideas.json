The entropy of the action distribution can be computed and added to the loss with a scaling factor that decays over time. Implement this by updating the `reinforce` function to calculate the entropy as `entropy = -dist.entropy().mean()`, and include it in the loss as `loss = -torch.stack(log_probs) * discounted_rewards + beta * entropy`, where `beta` is the entropy weight that decays over episodes. Adjust the `optimizer.step()` to account for this new loss definition.",
